<p>Success means different things for different people, some may equate it with fame, some with wealth and still some with accomplishments. For me, it means fulfilling one&rsquo;s dreams. Whatever your dreams are, you have a goal and then focus all your attention on it.</p>
<p>Dreams bring you hope and happiness. In the process of struggling for it, you cry, sweat, complain or even purse,but the joy of harvesting makes you forget all the pains and troubles you have gone through.So an old proverb says that the sweetest fruit is one that has undergone the bitterest ordeal.</p>
<p>There are several keys to success. First,your goal must be practical and practicable.If you set your goal too high, chance are that you will never attain it.Next,you have to make a plan for doing it. You can take some steps to realize it.Since the process is quite though., you need to be diligent,patient and persevering.</p>
<p>Even if you meet with some difficulties or frustrations, just take them in your stride.You can always tell yourself that  there is nothing insurmountable.With this will and determination, success is sure to wait for you at the end of the tunnel!</p>
